1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,849
now generally speaking when you think
about how all of this was right you have

2
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:15,179
information and you have rules and out
of back door conclusion so we sort of

3
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,420
have this general pan is . and that
makes sued

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:34,230
ok you think about what you've done and
then make sure I space what computers

5
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,410
actually really as kind of place you can
we'll get started this and just out of

6
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,218
that girl's blood to the up is what I
mean right I got away

7
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,719
let me give you a name for this event
for dial to the decision

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,440
ok it's called for would change because
as Mike going four dollars

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
decision-making orgy

10
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:08,310
now you may call the system start from a
decision and go back to what . yeah that

11
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,140
might seem a bit backwards to you which
is why it's called back machine but

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,020
actually as you'll see bit as humans we
both of these on a regular basis all the

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,960
time my questions trying to fly this
right

14
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,270
sometimes once useful sometimes the
others and some have the combination of

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,710
the time it's like to be back with other
side back to change

16
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,860
ok back to change now ya series i want
to make some kind of decision right so i

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,490
think i was talking about the weather
before and whether i should

18
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:52,789
next course in person i get up in the
morning and i'll tell you a lot about

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:58,850
two pieces of clothing now that question
should i wear jumpline extra doctor

20
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,899
today right

21
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:04,430
that's the decision right so actually my
starting point for starting point

22
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,840
he's a decision and I wanted to know
whether I should do it or not

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,800
what kind of variable they're on a
mission accomplished that

24
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,140
so in that case I've actually begun here
on this side and back with Shane right

25
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,750
so now that I've started with my
decision

26
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:25,069
I need to see sure you're not so now i'm
going to go search for some garlic that

27
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:31,910
relates the data see my phone and check
it out right or you know why fight them

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,510
something like that so I look at the
window optimize the air coming through

29
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:43,190
for so you see started this decision key
guys what . i should look at that except

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,920
so in some ways you might think this is
a convergent fresh right I'm sort of god

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,170
goal in mind for drilling towards that
once i'm going up information then I

32
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,920
don't need to look at anything else I
can make packaging is flourishing

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,100
well as it flies you just stop with the
decision you're gonna make you might

34
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,380
have no idea what decision you're going
to instead you just stop in the dog will

35
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,660
you write gather is much daughters can
get everything that you don't know when

36
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,980
it's gonna be really not just grab once
you've got all of that

37
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,210
try your best combine everything you got
here like and see all right what does

38
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,180
this lead to what decisions or decisions

39
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:40,370
mike is ladyboy now we've clearly that
wasn't such a good example for for

40
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,550
change that one back to changing
situations on the decision

41
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,440
look for some garlic but just yesterday
I have to make a decision which was for

42
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:57,320
change which was no should I shoes to be
the three people to get points for best

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,730
and fairest after sport

44
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,600
ok so if you don't know the system
best-and-fairest regrets for you

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,620
actually one person who gets the award
actually three and they get three points

46
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,140
two points was okay and at the end of
the season out of everyone . and then

47
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,070
you get rolled this very here's the
thing

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,858
oh I have I have 24 people like to teach
actually I don't get cool people who

49
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,510
played games with it because
unfortunately i didn't Jesus or also be

50
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,190
intimidated the other to do tell

51
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,260
so here so i just 12 players to choose
from ok so we go and look at my list

52
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,830
right now if i want to back with changes
it would look something like this

53
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,500
we're playing on the one who this person
get points for best affairs so there's

54
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,790
my decision that right and then figure
out okay what daughter relates to that

55
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,310
so then I I think back to the game on

56
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:59,420
this ball their school and so on ok so
then I don't think it now that I've got

57
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:06,920
pushed out can make a decision that yes
it might be just like the one where you

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,280
can start to see why this is a problem
an approach to this particular problem

59
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,280
right because having started this
decision okay I'm gonna do it again

60
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,710
yeah that's a very time to process this

61
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,630
so instead i'm going to start with the
dark

62
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,980
I'm going down going back to the game
first rather than any particular

63
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,750
decision and referred ok this is what
happened is what's to that this was

64
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,570
unusual unusual and authenticated based
on all of that . i'm going to make a

65
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,650
decision that this will be a person who
I think stood out the most and they're

66
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,859
going to get 31 only so because it
begins with the dollar

67
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,860
this is often called a planted driven

68
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:03,520
it's often what works best when you
simply turned out which choices to

69
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,469
actually stop ask what you can do is
look at the situation and well what do

70
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,129
we know

71
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:14,050
and therefore decisions can be made on
the basis of its often also very helpful

72
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,309
we're not just one you have to shoot
you're actually going to end up with a

73
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:25,989
few different included right business in
my knowledge base my rules might be

74
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:31,029
things like if someone scores right well
i would only want me to have three kids

75
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,289
and it's okay they're gonna be my top
contenders for best and fairest right so

76
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,179
there's a rule that's fired that's being
late with relevant right and then I have

77
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:43,929
a little bit of rules and put that all
together and see who are my top three so

78
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:52,239
yeah it's it's a different way of life
difference between
