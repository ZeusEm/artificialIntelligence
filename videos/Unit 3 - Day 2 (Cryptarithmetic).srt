1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
morning class sorry I can't be there
this morning

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,030
arm but it's ok we'll just do this over
video and today we're going to pick up

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,040
where we left off on friday we are in
unit 3 talking about eliminating

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,980
possibilities to solve problems

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,850
today's problems are all going to be
very similar the same type of problems

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,000
all day long and they're called crypt
arithmetic problems and they're not

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,980
exactly easy

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,940
ok they might not come easy to you at
first but I think with a little bit of

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,989
practice you'll understand them and
you'll get them and you'll do perfectly

10
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,059
fine arm after all things that are
worthwhile are difficult

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,329
so if they were all easy problems this
class will be very fun but the whole

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,539
point is to challenge you and and push
you and I think that these problems

13
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,899
today will will help push you armed

14
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,350
I'm going to go through a few examples
with you today

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,430
if at any time in the video though you
want to try the problem without hearing

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,480
the answer

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,250
you can pause the video try and work the
problem out in your notes and see how

18
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,880
you do and then play the video to see if
you got the same thing as me so that's

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,530
always a good strategy when you're
watching these videos to practice before

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,430
you hear the answer and then go ahead
and play it and see if you got the same

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,900
answers me

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,430
all right let's get started with the
first problem here the first problem is

23
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,520
called life on the farm and this is how
it goes

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,530
a meal and all have live on a farm with
their father Gordon one day email asked

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,990
his father dad what happened to that cat
we used to have all over heard this and

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,960
said yeah and we used to have a horse to
Gordon replied that Tomcat and that old

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,490
nag were no use

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,770
I traded them for our new goat email
said hey that sounds like a good script

29
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,360
arithmetic problem

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,770
come on all of let's see if we can solve
it they wrote down tom

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:03,240
Plus nag equals goat each letter stands
for a different digits 0 through 9 no 2

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,469
letters stand for the same digit
determine which digit each letter

33
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,410
represents

34
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:14,440
all right and that's kind of a lot of
language there but let's go to the next

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,230
slide and I kind of laid out what this
problem

36
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:24,790
looks like all right I apologize for my
sloppy handwriting but this is what the

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,650
problem looks like we're trying to add
up

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:32,590
Tom plus nag to equal goat and if you
can see over on the right-hand side

39
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,990
each letter has a different possibility
for which number it could be for

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,590
instance

41
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,280
t it could be zero one two three four
five six seven eight or nine

42
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,960
notice that he cannot be 10 or 25 each
letter can only be one digit 0 through 9

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,640
the other thing that we need to know is
that if t were five for instance then M

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,070
could not be five because it

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:11,049
the number can't repeat ok also kind of
along the same lines if the tea and tom

46
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,020
was five then the tea and goat would
also have to be five

47
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,620
ok so we're trying to figure out what
each letter represents what number does

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,060
each letter represent all right so let's
walk through this i'm going to go kind

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,040
of slow on this first one here

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,340
let's walk through this step-by-step the
first letter that I know for sure is i

51
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,780
know that G has to be a one and let me
try and explain that here

52
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,829
I think that G has to be one the reason
why I think that G has to be one is the

53
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,810
biggest number that T could be would be
nine

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,800
ok that's the biggest number possible 40
and 50 is nine the biggest number that

55
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:07,959
end could possibly be would be 80 k & 9
+ 8

56
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,420
those are the biggest possible answers
that they could be in 9 + ape only adds

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,040
up to 17

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,789
so see how that g at the show then would
be a seven and I'd carry the war

59
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:29,380
one and the g would be a 1 see that
there's no way that she could be a three

60
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,600
for instance because there's no way that
T plus n could add up to 30 something

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,400
right the biggest that T plus n could
add up to a 17

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,830
so that's why I know that g must be one
and I don't know about

63
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,060
Oh or n or tea

64
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:56,770
I don't know about any of those yet arm
but I do know that g must be one

65
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,719
ok and if the g and goat is one than the
g and meg is also one so i'm going to

66
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,590
put a one there by that G over all my
letters over here

67
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,060
hopefully you can jot down something
like this on your notes because what i

68
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,260
want to do is I want to eliminate
possibilities so I know that g is 1 i'm

69
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,620
going to go ahead and circle the one
down there by G which means i can

70
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,330
eliminate the 0 in the 2 and the 3 and
the 4 and the 5 and the 6 and 7 and the

71
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,620
eight and the nine

72
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,300
the other thing that I can do is I can
eliminate the other letters i know that

73
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,290
a cannot be won I know that end cannot
be won em cannot be 10 cannot be 1 and T

74
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,520
cannot be won

75
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,599
ok so already now I've eliminated some
possibilities

76
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,710
alright the next thing that I'm looking
at as I look at this problem and this is

77
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,120
not easy

78
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,480
hey it's kind of difficult no doubt
about it but when i look at the this

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:03,610
Oh plus a equals a the oh and Tom the a
and nag and the a and go 0 plus a equals

80
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,840
a

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,960
okay or you know something

82
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,890
plus a equals a

83
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,020
alright so when I think about that I
think that

84
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:29,650
Oh must have to be 0 because 0 plus a
would equal a right 0 plus 4 is 40 plus

85
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,099
8 is 8 so i think that the 0 in

86
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:41,040
arm has to be a 0 and if that o is a0
than the Owen goat also has to be a zero

87
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,390
so i'm going to go ahead and fill those
in 20 so I'm my own up here i'm going to

88
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:51,000
circle the zero cross out the two three
four five six seven eight and nine

89
00:06:51,780 --> 00:07:00,239
cross out the ont & M and N and a ok
I've eliminated some possibilities here

90
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,590
I know that the 0 is 0 the g is one

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:11,969
now let's look at this T plus n t plus n
t plus n has to equal 10

92
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,170
ok so there's only so many numbers that
can add up to ten one thing is 5 plus 5

93
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,430
equals 10

94
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,930
but if t is five then n can't be five so
i know that that's not the right answer

95
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:31,260
ok so at this point what you can do is
you can just kind of make some guesses

96
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,900
and try it and see if it works out

97
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,530
and if it doesn't work out then at least
you know that that's not the answer and

98
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:45,419
you can eliminate that possibility but
for me I know that 7 plus 3 equals 10

99
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:51,570
so i'm going to go ahead and try that
i'm going to try seven for my tea and

100
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:58,200
three for my end and if the tea and
Thomas seven then the tea and goat must

101
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,099
be seven

102
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,950
ok so i'm going to go ahead and circle
those ones over here i think t might be

103
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:12,750
seven so I'm going to eliminate the
other numbers that also means that m is

104
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,710
not seven and n is not seven and a is
not seven

105
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:22,169
I think that the n is 3 so I'm going to
circle 34 n cross out the other numbers

106
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:28,890
ok which means that m is not 3a is not
three

107
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,050
there we go

108
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,430
i'm going down to just a few
possibilities now all right let's look

109
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:35,909
at that

110
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:41,610
em up there that m m+ one has to equal 7

111
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:50,310
so that means that M must be six right
because six plus one equals seven so m

112
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,089
is six cross out the other possibilities

113
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,729
I know that a can't be six

114
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:07,740
ok excellent and so now the only letter
that i'm left with is a ok and when I

115
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,959
look at my possibilities for a a could
be 245 eight or nine

116
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,920
as long as I choose any of those numbers
I think this problem is going to work

117
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,729
out

118
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,420
so let's just choose i think five is a
lucky number so i'm going to choose 5

119
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,140
for a and if the day and nag is five and
the a and goat must be five guys on the

120
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,439
circle five cross out the other
possibilities

121
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,860
there we go I've got it

122
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,220
ok so now what I want to do is I just
want to double check my answer and make

123
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,279
sure that everything makes sense i'm
going to start over on the right

124
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,339
six plus one equals seven

125
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,300
that makes sense zero plus 5 equals 5

126
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,560
that makes sense and seven plus three
equals 10

127
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,550
that also makes sense so on this
particular problem

128
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:06,599
one possible solution is 706 + 350 1
equals 1057 ok and then this particular

129
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,720
problem there's more than one correct
answer you could have had a couple

130
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,250
different things but that's how you end
up with your answer

131
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,209
ok so let's try another problem

132
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,050
this next problem there's only one
possible answer so that makes it a

133
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,010
little bit trickier in some ways but in
some ways it also makes it a little bit

134
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,890
easier because you can eliminate more
possibilities

135
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,380
ok let's look at the next problem the
next problem is called the letter from

136
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,300
college and this is how it goes

137
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,140
the story goes that a young man away at
college needed some extra cash

138
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,550
he sent his mother this plea

139
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:48,290
he wanted her to send the amount
indicated by the following some send

140
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,959
plus more equals money

141
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,010
each letter stands for a different
digits 0 through 9 no 2 letters stand

142
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,360
for the same digit

143
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,990
how much money did the young man want
assume that there's a decimal point

144
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,380
between the end in the e because his
mother is probably not willing to send

145
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,769
10,000 or so dollars to her son on
request

146
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:11,930
alright so when I go to the next slide
of them up again I apologize for the

147
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,189
sloppy handwriting but on this is how it
what I've got of that sin

148
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,670
plus more equals money along the
right-hand side

149
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,750
I just listed all of the letters that
were in this problem

150
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,050
ok so there are one two three four five
six seven eight letters in this problem

151
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,510
each letter has 10 possibilities ok so
there's only so many possibilities a lot

152
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,110
of students get really really
overwhelmed when they're solving these

153
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,990
problems but remember that there's only
10 possibilities for each letter so if

154
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,519
you get stuck on a letter

155
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,149
the most you're going to have to try
it's 10 different possibilities which

156
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,570
you probably want to try 10 because i'm
sure you can eliminate some of those

157
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,329
possibilities from the start

158
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:02,390
ok but let's try not to get overwhelmed
let's try this problem the first letter

159
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,350
that we should look at is that em out in
front our money

160
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,779
ok because in the last problem we went
through in realize that M has only one

161
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,829
possible choice

162
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:18,560
m must be equal to 1 ok and we kind of
figured that out on the last problem so

163
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,750
m is equal to 1

164
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,750
I can eliminate some possibilities then

165
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:33,480
i know that s can be 1 & II can't be won
and the 0 ry

166
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,459
none of those numbers can be one ok and
if the am and money is one then the am

167
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,319
and more must be one

168
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,649
all right very good

169
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,430
next the next number that i personally
see is this

170
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:57,599
s i know that s plus 1 has to equal 10
or more because i need to carry this one

171
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,730
out here to the M and money

172
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,240
ok so s plus 1 has to equal 10 or more

173
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:11,820
well there's not you know s can't be 12
or 13 at the biggest number that s could

174
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:23,399
be as nine and nine plus 1 is 10 ok so
that's what it has to be s has to be 9

175
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:31,230
so 9 plus 1 is 10 let me get caught up
over here i know that s must be nine so

176
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:38,279
it's not a date it's not seven cents
it's by 4 30 to 40 and he's not nine

177
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,220
across all these possibilities out and
all this crossing all this stuff out it

178
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,839
may seem like a bit of a trouble but
when you get down towards the end of the

179
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,760
problem it will help you so much when
you when you've eliminated so many of

180
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,990
the possibilities

181
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,680
you only have one or two possibilities
left it will save you I promise

182
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,010
ok I also know that Oh must be 0 so it's
not two three four five six seven eight

183
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,360
or nine and also he's not 0 and 90

184
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,959
I can eliminate all of those
possibilities ok if the oh and money is

185
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:18,239
not our 20 excuse me

186
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,240
then the oh and more must be 0

187
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:31,760
ok so here we get to a funny situation
when we look at the E and send be plus 0

188
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:40,850
equals n and that doesn't make sense you
think he + 0 would equal e right but um

189
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,120
this is kind of a conundrum that we run
into

190
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,150
there's no way that he + 0 could equal
end because he plus 0 is e the only way

191
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:56,329
we could do that is if n plus R equals
something more than 10 and then we had

192
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:06,920
to carry a 1 up there above the ec that
ok then this might work out

193
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:17,570
ok so let's try a number for e and maybe
let's just try for let's try for

194
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,050
ok so I'm going to put a four in here
for e which means i need a for down here

195
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,449
and a 4 right there

196
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:34,670
ok and one plus four is five so the end
must be five

197
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:44,959
there we go now we're in another kind of
sticky situation here when we look at

198
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:56,540
the n plus R + + r has to equal 14 + +
RS equal 14 so 5 plus what equals 14

199
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,870
well you would think it would be nine
but the problem is that i've already

200
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,930
used in the nine so our can't be nine

201
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:09,380
so again when i figure out when i look
at this long enough as i know that our

202
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:16,520
must be eight and d + e must equal
something more than 10 because then i

203
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:25,310
have to carry a 1 up there above the 51
plus 5 and 6 6 plus 8 is 14 and then 1

204
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,550
plus 4 is 5 9 plus 1 is 10 so on and so
forth

205
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,770
all right which brings me to D and why

206
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,670
ok let me fill in some of this other
information here I know that

207
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,670
is for cross out cross out

208
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,040
I know that what else do I know our is
eight

209
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,590
okay i know that n is 5

210
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:17,420
and I think that's all I no no

211
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,939
alright so when i'm looking at this i'm
down to D and wine look at look at that

212
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:27,329
I've eliminated most of the
possibilities for d and why

213
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:38,070
here's the deal though is d + 4 has to
equal number bigger than 10 so

214
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:53,280
d the biggest number that d could be is
70 k + 7 + 4 is only 11

215
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,080
here's the problem though is that one
has already been used em is one

216
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,730
dang it not quite going to work out

217
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,730
ok so let's change some numbers here

218
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,750
see this is how L eliminating
possibilities works as you try some

219
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,510
possibilities and see if they work and
if they don't work then you try

220
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,620
something different

221
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:19,199
let's say that he isn't for let's say
that

222
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:30,929
e is five ok now we have seven plus 5 is
in 11

223
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,040
now that's 12

224
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,970
carry the 1 and can't be five anymore

225
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,740
let's say n is 6

226
00:18:46,740 --> 00:19:01,290
here we go 1 plus 6 and 7 7 plus 8 is 15
so again this isn't for any more it's 15

227
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,149
carry the one

228
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:20,100
this e up here isn't for it must be a 5
1 plus 5 is 6 6 plus 0 is six and the

229
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,870
end up on sand is safe so it's a good
thing that the end I'm here and money

230
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,770
and six

231
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,639
so my gosh i think that that works

232
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,970
ok I think that 900

233
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:42,000
look sorry 9560 7 plus 1085 equals ten
thousand six hundred and fifty-two let's

234
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,679
just go through it one more time step by
step to make sure that it works 7 plus 5

235
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,520
is 12

236
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,770
carry the 1 1 plus 6 and 7 7 plus 8 is
15

237
00:19:52,770 --> 00:20:01,170
carry the 1 1 plus 5 is 6 6 plus 0 is 69
plus 1 is 10 carry the one

238
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,000
excellent work so that's the solution to
this problem and it's not always going

239
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,780
to work out perfectly as we saw in this
example we found out that he could not

240
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,780
be four he had to be five

241
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,920
ok so let's try one more example in this
next example it's called here she comes

242
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,580
and it's here plus xi equals comes and
this problem is the same rules each

243
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,850
letter has to be a digit 0 through 9 no
2 letters can be the same digit same

244
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,500
rules that we've been playing all day

245
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,300
again this is a good chance for you to
pause the video and try this one out on

246
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,610
your own see if you can do it all on
your own and then watch the video and

247
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,990
see how I did

248
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,830
ok so I'm going to go to the next screen
again it's a good idea deposit and try

249
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,210
but i'm going to go ahead and solve this
thing ok

250
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,250
as I'm working here again the first
thing that I look at is the sea out

251
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,299
front I know that that C has to be a one
it can't be anything bigger than that he

252
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,490
has to be a one and eliminate some
possibilities here in just a moment

253
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,379
I

254
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,070
next then I look at that H and I don't
know that

255
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,669
h+ nothing has to equal 10 or bigger

256
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,190
hey so that's tough to do because the
biggest number H could be as a nine so

257
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,980
i'm going to go ahead and assume that H
must be 9 h is nine

258
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:55,168
all right and if the h and here is nine
then the h and she is also nine so we

259
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,429
know that I also know that i must be
carrying a one up here at the top

260
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:03,389
because 1 plus 9 equals 10

261
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:06,570
ok so that

262
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,789
Oh must be 0 so i know that i know all
must be 0

263
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:30,400
there we go it's coming along now ok now
I'm to the part where and i'm not

264
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,210
exactly sure where to go next so what I
need to do is I just need to try some

265
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,280
arm different numbers and see if they
work or not I had to do some trial and

266
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,879
error

267
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,440
sometimes it might work sometimes it
doesn't work ok so let's look at me

268
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,000
there's 1 2 3 4 e's so if i could figure
out yet but I could figure out the rest

269
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,020
of this problem

270
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,129
let's make a guess 4e ok last time he
was five

271
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,420
so let's try that again see if it works
again let's try

272
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:09,730
II that's 5k and already I can see that
that's not going to work because 5+5

273
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,220
would equal zero which means s would
have to be 0 and s can't be 0 because 0

274
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,860
is already 0 so that's not going to work

275
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,449
he can't be five so let me get my eraser
out

276
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:34,840
he's not five I know that ok so over on
my own chart over here I know that II

277
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
can't be five eliminate that possibility

278
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:45,010
ok let's try for maybe he is for that's
worth a try

279
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,150
ok four plus for then would be eight so
s might be eight means this s is eight

280
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,470
ok that looks good so far

281
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:09,429
then r + 9 has to equal 4 r plus 9 is
equal for that means our must be five is

282
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:20,559
five plus nine is 14 then I could carry
a 1 over here 1 plus 4 is 55 plus 8 is

283
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,620
the team carry the one which I needed

284
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:28,299
hey how it looks like we have a winner
here let's double check our answer

285
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:34,809
really quick go through to make sure
that it makes sense if he is 44 plus 4

286
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:38,168
is 8 s must be eight

287
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,120
ok then five plus nine is 14

288
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:51,969
carry the 1 1 plus 4 is 55 plus 8 is 13
carry the 1 1 plus 9 is 10 carry the one

289
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,480
so it looks like there's our answer i'm
going to go ahead and fill in my chart

290
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,590
here real quick

291
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:01,570
I found my answer

292
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,120
notice I didn't get my answer right on
the first try first I thought that he

293
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,469
was five

294
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,690
ok and so I did a little bit of math and
figured out that there's no way each

295
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,610
could have been five so i eliminated
five from the possibilities and I just

296
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,049
tried a different number

297
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,070
and don't be afraid to just do some
trial and error and try different

298
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,070
numbers out and see if you can come up
with the right one

299
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,500
all right it looks like I finished that
problem

300
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
the next slide is your homework problem

301
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,670
ok and this one you're going to have to
try all on your own if you want to work

302
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,700
with a partner to solve this one that's
okay you can work with a partner

303
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:49,520
the next one is called wow wow so cook

304
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,810
ok and it goes like this i dinnae was
having an argument with her roommate

305
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,520
Frankie about whether or not Frankie
could cook after arguing for a while

306
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,670
then they said wow so cook

307
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:07,310
Frankie who was a math teacher noticed
that donate what dinnae said might be a

308
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,200
crypt arithmetic problem

309
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,860
she sat down to work on it and then they
ended up cooking dinner

310
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,120
each letter in the crypt arithmetic
problem stands for a different digit

311
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,469
hint

312
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,130
k equals nine okay so they're giving UK

313
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,969
that's good i know that k equals nine

314
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,470
I also know that see got to equal one

315
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,730
so there's only three letters less a w +
0 and then s

316
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,000
those are the only three letters that
you have to figure out this problem

317
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,980
looks really really simple but it's a
little trickier than you think so you've

318
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,730
got to be very careful with it but you
only have three letters to figure out w

319
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,340
ons if you can solve this problem

320
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,980
you don't need to write any paragraphs
today just um solve this problem find

321
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,690
out what W equals what o is equal and
what s equals good luck I hope this

322
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,140
comes easy to you if you need to go back
and watch this video game that's no

323
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,920
problem

324
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,960
thank you and i will see you soon bye
