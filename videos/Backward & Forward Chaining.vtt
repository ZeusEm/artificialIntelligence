WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849 align:middle line:90%
now generally speaking when you think
about how all of this was right you have

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.179 align:middle line:90%
information and you have rules and out
of back door conclusion so we sort of

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.420 align:middle line:90%
have this general pan is . and that
makes sued

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
ok you think about what you've done and
then make sure I space what computers

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:90%
actually really as kind of place you can
we'll get started this and just out of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.219 align:middle line:90%
that girl's blood to the up is what I
mean right I got away

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.719 align:middle line:90%
let me give you a name for this event
for dial to the decision

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
ok it's called for would change because
as Mike going four dollars

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.969 align:middle line:84%
decision-making orgy

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:90%
now you may call the system start from a
decision and go back to what . yeah that

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:90%
might seem a bit backwards to you which
is why it's called back machine but

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.020 align:middle line:90%
actually as you'll see bit as humans we
both of these on a regular basis all the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:90%
time my questions trying to fly this
right

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:90%
sometimes once useful sometimes the
others and some have the combination of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.710 align:middle line:90%
the time it's like to be back with other
side back to change

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:90%
ok back to change now ya series i want
to make some kind of decision right so i

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:90%
think i was talking about the weather
before and whether i should

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:90%
next course in person i get up in the
morning and i'll tell you a lot about

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.850 align:middle line:90%
two pieces of clothing now that question
should i wear jumpline extra doctor

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.899 align:middle line:84%
today right

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:90%
that's the decision right so actually my
starting point for starting point

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
he's a decision and I wanted to know
whether I should do it or not

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.489 align:middle line:90%
what kind of variable they're on a
mission accomplished that

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.140 align:middle line:90%
so in that case I've actually begun here
on this side and back with Shane right

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:90%
so now that I've started with my
decision

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.069 align:middle line:90%
I need to see sure you're not so now i'm
going to go search for some garlic that

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
relates the data see my phone and check
it out right or you know why fight them

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.510 align:middle line:90%
something like that so I look at the
window optimize the air coming through

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:90%
for so you see started this decision key
guys what . i should look at that except

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:90%
so in some ways you might think this is
a convergent fresh right I'm sort of god

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:90%
goal in mind for drilling towards that
once i'm going up information then I

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:90%
don't need to look at anything else I
can make packaging is flourishing

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
well as it flies you just stop with the
decision you're gonna make you might

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:90%
have no idea what decision you're going
to instead you just stop in the dog will

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:90%
you write gather is much daughters can
get everything that you don't know when

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:90%
it's gonna be really not just grab once
you've got all of that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:90%
try your best combine everything you got
here like and see all right what does

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
this lead to what decisions or decisions

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.370 align:middle line:90%
mike is ladyboy now we've clearly that
wasn't such a good example for for

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
change that one back to changing
situations on the decision

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:90%
look for some garlic but just yesterday
I have to make a decision which was for

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
change which was no should I shoes to be
the three people to get points for best

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and fairest after sport

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:90%
ok so if you don't know the system
best-and-fairest regrets for you

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:90%
actually one person who gets the award
actually three and they get three points

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.140 align:middle line:90%
two points was okay and at the end of
the season out of everyone . and then

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.640 align:middle line:90%
you get rolled this very here's the
thing

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.858 align:middle line:90%
oh I have I have 24 people like to teach
actually I don't get cool people who

00:04:21.858 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:90%
played games with it because
unfortunately i didn't Jesus or also be

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:84%
intimidated the other to do tell

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:90%
so here so i just 12 players to choose
from ok so we go and look at my list

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:90%
right now if i want to back with changes
it would look something like this

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:90%
we're playing on the one who this person
get points for best affairs so there's

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:90%
my decision that right and then figure
out okay what daughter relates to that

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
so then I I think back to the game on

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.420 align:middle line:90%
this ball their school and so on ok so
then I don't think it now that I've got

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:90%
pushed out can make a decision that yes
it might be just like the one where you

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:90%
can start to see why this is a problem
an approach to this particular problem

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.790 align:middle line:90%
right because having started this
decision okay I'm gonna do it again

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
yeah that's a very time to process this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
so instead i'm going to start with the
dark

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm going down going back to the game
first rather than any particular

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:90%
decision and referred ok this is what
happened is what's to that this was

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:90%
unusual unusual and authenticated based
on all of that . i'm going to make a

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:90%
decision that this will be a person who
I think stood out the most and they're

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
going to get 31 only so because it
begins with the dollar

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:57.129 align:middle line:84%
this is often called a planted driven

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:90%
it's often what works best when you
simply turned out which choices to

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.469 align:middle line:90%
actually stop ask what you can do is
look at the situation and well what do

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:09.129 align:middle line:84%
we know

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and therefore decisions can be made on
the basis of its often also very helpful

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.309 align:middle line:90%
we're not just one you have to shoot
you're actually going to end up with a

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:25.989 align:middle line:90%
few different included right business in
my knowledge base my rules might be

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:31.029 align:middle line:90%
things like if someone scores right well
i would only want me to have three kids

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.289 align:middle line:90%
and it's okay they're gonna be my top
contenders for best and fairest right so

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.179 align:middle line:90%
there's a rule that's fired that's being
late with relevant right and then I have

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:43.929 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of rules and put that all
together and see who are my top three so

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:48.929 align:middle line:90%
yeah it's it's a different way of life
difference between
