00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290 align:middle line:90%
morning class sorry I can't be there
this morning

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030 align:middle line:90%
arm but it's ok we'll just do this over
video and today we're going to pick up

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040 align:middle line:90%
where we left off on friday we are in
unit 3 talking about eliminating

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.980 align:middle line:84%
possibilities to solve problems

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.850 align:middle line:90%
today's problems are all going to be
very similar the same type of problems

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%
all day long and they're called crypt
arithmetic problems and they're not

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.980 align:middle line:84%
exactly easy

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:90%
ok they might not come easy to you at
first but I think with a little bit of

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989 align:middle line:90%
practice you'll understand them and
you'll get them and you'll do perfectly

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.059 align:middle line:90%
fine arm after all things that are
worthwhile are difficult

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.329 align:middle line:90%
so if they were all easy problems this
class will be very fun but the whole

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.539 align:middle line:90%
point is to challenge you and and push
you and I think that these problems

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.899 align:middle line:84%
today will will help push you armed

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go through a few examples
with you today

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:90%
if at any time in the video though you
want to try the problem without hearing

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.480 align:middle line:84%
the answer

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:90%
you can pause the video try and work the
problem out in your notes and see how

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:90%
you do and then play the video to see if
you got the same thing as me so that's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530 align:middle line:90%
always a good strategy when you're
watching these videos to practice before

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
you hear the answer and then go ahead
and play it and see if you got the same

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
answers me

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.430 align:middle line:90%
all right let's get started with the
first problem here the first problem is

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:90%
called life on the farm and this is how
it goes

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.530 align:middle line:90%
a meal and all have live on a farm with
their father Gordon one day email asked

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.990 align:middle line:90%
his father dad what happened to that cat
we used to have all over heard this and

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
said yeah and we used to have a horse to
Gordon replied that Tomcat and that old

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:84%
nag were no use

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.770 align:middle line:90%
I traded them for our new goat email
said hey that sounds like a good script

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
arithmetic problem

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
come on all of let's see if we can solve
it they wrote down tom

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Plus nag equals goat each letter stands
for a different digits 0 through 9 no 2

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.469 align:middle line:90%
letters stand for the same digit
determine which digit each letter

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
represents

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:90%
all right and that's kind of a lot of
language there but let's go to the next

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:90%
slide and I kind of laid out what this
problem

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:90%
looks like all right I apologize for my
sloppy handwriting but this is what the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:90%
problem looks like we're trying to add
up

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Tom plus nag to equal goat and if you
can see over on the right-hand side

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:90%
each letter has a different possibility
for which number it could be for

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
instance

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.280 align:middle line:90%
t it could be zero one two three four
five six seven eight or nine

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:90%
notice that he cannot be 10 or 25 each
letter can only be one digit 0 through 9

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.640 align:middle line:90%
the other thing that we need to know is
that if t were five for instance then M

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.070 align:middle line:84%
could not be five because it

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:90%
the number can't repeat ok also kind of
along the same lines if the tea and tom

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:90%
was five then the tea and goat would
also have to be five

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.620 align:middle line:90%
ok so we're trying to figure out what
each letter represents what number does

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.060 align:middle line:90%
each letter represent all right so let's
walk through this i'm going to go kind

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
of slow on this first one here

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:90%
let's walk through this step-by-step the
first letter that I know for sure is i

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:90%
know that G has to be a one and let me
try and explain that here

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I think that G has to be one the reason
why I think that G has to be one is the

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
biggest number that T could be would be
nine

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.800 align:middle line:90%
ok that's the biggest number possible 40
and 50 is nine the biggest number that

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:07.959 align:middle line:90%
end could possibly be would be 80 k & 9
+ 8

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.420 align:middle line:90%
those are the biggest possible answers
that they could be in 9 + ape only adds

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
up to 17

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:90%
so see how that g at the show then would
be a seven and I'd carry the war

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:90%
one and the g would be a 1 see that
there's no way that she could be a three

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:90%
for instance because there's no way that
T plus n could add up to 30 something

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:90%
right the biggest that T plus n could
add up to a 17

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
so that's why I know that g must be one
and I don't know about

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh or n or tea

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about any of those yet arm
but I do know that g must be one

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.720 align:middle line:90%
ok and if the g and goat is one than the
g and meg is also one so i'm going to

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
put a one there by that G over all my
letters over here

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:90%
hopefully you can jot down something
like this on your notes because what i

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:90%
want to do is I want to eliminate
possibilities so I know that g is 1 i'm

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.620 align:middle line:90%
going to go ahead and circle the one
down there by G which means i can

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:90%
eliminate the 0 in the 2 and the 3 and
the 4 and the 5 and the 6 and 7 and the

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
eight and the nine

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:90%
the other thing that I can do is I can
eliminate the other letters i know that

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:90%
a cannot be won I know that end cannot
be won em cannot be 10 cannot be 1 and T

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.520 align:middle line:84%
cannot be won

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.110 align:middle line:90%
ok so already now I've eliminated some
possibilities

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:90%
alright the next thing that I'm looking
at as I look at this problem and this is

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.120 align:middle line:84%
not easy

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
hey it's kind of difficult no doubt
about it but when i look at the this

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh plus a equals a the oh and Tom the a
and nag and the a and go 0 plus a equals

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.840 align:middle line:84%
a

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
okay or you know something

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
plus a equals a

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:90%
alright so when I think about that I
think that

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Oh must have to be 0 because 0 plus a
would equal a right 0 plus 4 is 40 plus

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:84%
8 is 8 so i think that the 0 in

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:41.040 align:middle line:90%
arm has to be a 0 and if that o is a0
than the Owen goat also has to be a zero

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:90%
so i'm going to go ahead and fill those
in 20 so I'm my own up here i'm going to

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
circle the zero cross out the two three
four five six seven eight and nine

00:06:51.780 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:90%
cross out the ont & M and N and a ok
I've eliminated some possibilities here

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I know that the 0 is 0 the g is one

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:90%
now let's look at this T plus n t plus n
t plus n has to equal 10

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:90%
ok so there's only so many numbers that
can add up to ten one thing is 5 plus 5

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
equals 10

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%
but if t is five then n can't be five so
i know that that's not the right answer

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:90%
ok so at this point what you can do is
you can just kind of make some guesses

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and try it and see if it works out

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and if it doesn't work out then at least
you know that that's not the answer and

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:90%
you can eliminate that possibility but
for me I know that 7 plus 3 equals 10

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:51.570 align:middle line:90%
so i'm going to go ahead and try that
i'm going to try seven for my tea and

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:58.200 align:middle line:90%
three for my end and if the tea and
Thomas seven then the tea and goat must

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
be seven

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.950 align:middle line:90%
ok so i'm going to go ahead and circle
those ones over here i think t might be

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:90%
seven so I'm going to eliminate the
other numbers that also means that m is

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:90%
not seven and n is not seven and a is
not seven

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:22.169 align:middle line:90%
I think that the n is 3 so I'm going to
circle 34 n cross out the other numbers

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:90%
ok which means that m is not 3a is not
three

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
there we go

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:90%
i'm going down to just a few
possibilities now all right let's look

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
at that

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:42.149 align:middle line:84%
em up there that m m+ one has to equal 7

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:90%
so that means that M must be six right
because six plus one equals seven so m

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
is six cross out the other possibilities

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.730 align:middle line:84%
I know that a can't be six

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:90%
ok excellent and so now the only letter
that i'm left with is a ok and when I

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.959 align:middle line:90%
look at my possibilities for a a could
be 245 eight or nine

00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:90%
as long as I choose any of those numbers
I think this problem is going to work

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
out

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.420 align:middle line:90%
so let's just choose i think five is a
lucky number so i'm going to choose 5

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:90%
for a and if the day and nag is five and
the a and goat must be five guys on the

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
circle five cross out the other
possibilities

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
there we go I've got it

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:90%
ok so now what I want to do is I just
want to double check my answer and make

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.279 align:middle line:90%
sure that everything makes sense i'm
going to start over on the right

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:44.339 align:middle line:84%
six plus one equals seven

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that makes sense zero plus 5 equals 5

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:90%
that makes sense and seven plus three
equals 10

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:90%
that also makes sense so on this
particular problem

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:06.600 align:middle line:90%
one possible solution is 706 + 350 1
equals 1057 ok and then this particular

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.720 align:middle line:90%
problem there's more than one correct
answer you could have had a couple

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:90%
different things but that's how you end
up with your answer

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.209 align:middle line:84%
ok so let's try another problem

00:10:18.209 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:90%
this next problem there's only one
possible answer so that makes it a

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:90%
little bit trickier in some ways but in
some ways it also makes it a little bit

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.890 align:middle line:90%
easier because you can eliminate more
possibilities

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:34.380 align:middle line:90%
ok let's look at the next problem the
next problem is called the letter from

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
college and this is how it goes

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:90%
the story goes that a young man away at
college needed some extra cash

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.550 align:middle line:84%
he sent his mother this plea

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:48.290 align:middle line:90%
he wanted her to send the amount
indicated by the following some send

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.959 align:middle line:84%
plus more equals money

00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:55.010 align:middle line:90%
each letter stands for a different
digits 0 through 9 no 2 letters stand

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
for the same digit

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:90%
how much money did the young man want
assume that there's a decimal point

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:90%
between the end in the e because his
mother is probably not willing to send

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.769 align:middle line:90%
10,000 or so dollars to her son on
request

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:90%
alright so when I go to the next slide
of them up again I apologize for the

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:90%
sloppy handwriting but on this is how it
what I've got of that sin

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.670 align:middle line:90%
plus more equals money along the
right-hand side

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:90%
I just listed all of the letters that
were in this problem

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:30.649 align:middle line:90%
ok so there are one two three four five
six seven eight letters in this problem

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:90%
each letter has 10 possibilities ok so
there's only so many possibilities a lot

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:90%
of students get really really
overwhelmed when they're solving these

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:90%
problems but remember that there's only
10 possibilities for each letter so if

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.519 align:middle line:84%
you get stuck on a letter

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:50.149 align:middle line:90%
the most you're going to have to try
it's 10 different possibilities which

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:53.570 align:middle line:90%
you probably want to try 10 because i'm
sure you can eliminate some of those

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.329 align:middle line:84%
possibilities from the start

00:11:56.329 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:90%
ok but let's try not to get overwhelmed
let's try this problem the first letter

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:90%
that we should look at is that em out in
front our money

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:11.779 align:middle line:90%
ok because in the last problem we went
through in realize that M has only one

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:12.829 align:middle line:84%
possible choice

00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:90%
m must be equal to 1 ok and we kind of
figured that out on the last problem so

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.750 align:middle line:84%
m is equal to 1

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I can eliminate some possibilities then

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:90%
i know that s can be 1 & II can't be won
and the 0 ry

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.459 align:middle line:90%
none of those numbers can be one ok and
if the am and money is one then the am

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and more must be one

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.649 align:middle line:84%
all right very good

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:90%
next the next number that i personally
see is this

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:90%
s i know that s plus 1 has to equal 10
or more because i need to carry this one

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.730 align:middle line:84%
out here to the M and money

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.240 align:middle line:84%
ok so s plus 1 has to equal 10 or more

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:11.820 align:middle line:90%
well there's not you know s can't be 12
or 13 at the biggest number that s could

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:23.399 align:middle line:90%
be as nine and nine plus 1 is 10 ok so
that's what it has to be s has to be 9

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:90%
so 9 plus 1 is 10 let me get caught up
over here i know that s must be nine so

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:38.279 align:middle line:90%
it's not a date it's not seven cents
it's by 4 30 to 40 and he's not nine

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:44.220 align:middle line:90%
across all these possibilities out and
all this crossing all this stuff out it

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.839 align:middle line:90%
may seem like a bit of a trouble but
when you get down towards the end of the

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:90%
problem it will help you so much when
you when you've eliminated so many of

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.990 align:middle line:84%
the possibilities

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:90%
you only have one or two possibilities
left it will save you I promise

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:90%
ok I also know that Oh must be 0 so it's
not two three four five six seven eight

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
or nine and also he's not 0 and 90

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:15.959 align:middle line:90%
I can eliminate all of those
possibilities ok if the oh and money is

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
not our 20 excuse me

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
then the oh and more must be 0

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:90%
ok so here we get to a funny situation
when we look at the E and send be plus 0

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:90%
equals n and that doesn't make sense you
think he + 0 would equal e right but um

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:90%
this is kind of a conundrum that we run
into

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:90%
there's no way that he + 0 could equal
end because he plus 0 is e the only way

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:90%
we could do that is if n plus R equals
something more than 10 and then we had

00:14:56.330 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:90%
to carry a 1 up there above the ec that
ok then this might work out

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:18.110 align:middle line:90%
ok so let's try a number for e and maybe
let's just try for let's try for

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:90%
ok so I'm going to put a four in here
for e which means i need a for down here

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and a 4 right there

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:90%
ok and one plus four is five so the end
must be five

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:44.960 align:middle line:90%
there we go now we're in another kind of
sticky situation here when we look at

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:90%
the n plus R + + r has to equal 14 + +
RS equal 14 so 5 plus what equals 14

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:90%
well you would think it would be nine
but the problem is that i've already

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:84%
used in the nine so our can't be nine

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:90%
so again when i figure out when i look
at this long enough as i know that our

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:90%
must be eight and d + e must equal
something more than 10 because then i

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:90%
have to carry a 1 up there above the 51
plus 5 and 6 6 plus 8 is 14 and then 1

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.360 align:middle line:90%
plus 4 is 5 9 plus 1 is 10 so on and so
forth

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
all right which brings me to D and why

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.670 align:middle line:90%
ok let me fill in some of this other
information here I know that

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:47.320 align:middle line:84%
is for cross out cross out

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:90%
I know that what else do I know our is
eight

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:10.190 align:middle line:84%
okay i know that n is 5

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's all I no no

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.939 align:middle line:90%
alright so when i'm looking at this i'm
down to D and wine look at look at that

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:90%
I've eliminated most of the
possibilities for d and why

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:90%
here's the deal though is d + 4 has to
equal number bigger than 10 so

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:53.850 align:middle line:90%
d the biggest number that d could be is
70 k + 7 + 4 is only 11

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.080 align:middle line:90%
here's the problem though is that one
has already been used em is one

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:84%
dang it not quite going to work out

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:84%
ok so let's change some numbers here

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.750 align:middle line:90%
see this is how L eliminating
possibilities works as you try some

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:90%
possibilities and see if they work and
if they don't work then you try

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.620 align:middle line:84%
something different

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:90%
let's say that he isn't for let's say
that

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:30.929 align:middle line:90%
e is five ok now we have seven plus 5 is
in 11

00:18:30.929 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
now that's 12

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
carry the 1 and can't be five anymore

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:46.740 align:middle line:84%
let's say n is 6

00:18:46.740 --> 00:19:01.290 align:middle line:90%
here we go 1 plus 6 and 7 7 plus 8 is 15
so again this isn't for any more it's 15

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:03.150 align:middle line:84%
carry the one

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:90%
this e up here isn't for it must be a 5
1 plus 5 is 6 6 plus 0 is six and the

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:90%
end up on sand is safe so it's a good
thing that the end I'm here and money

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and six

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:84%
so my gosh i think that that works

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
ok I think that 900

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:90%
look sorry 9560 7 plus 1085 equals ten
thousand six hundred and fifty-two let's

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.679 align:middle line:90%
just go through it one more time step by
step to make sure that it works 7 plus 5

00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is 12

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
carry the 1 1 plus 6 and 7 7 plus 8 is

00:19:52.770 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:90%
carry the 1 1 plus 5 is 6 6 plus 0 is 69
plus 1 is 10 carry the one

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:90%
excellent work so that's the solution to
this problem and it's not always going

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:90%
to work out perfectly as we saw in this
example we found out that he could not

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
be four he had to be five

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:90%
ok so let's try one more example in this
next example it's called here she comes

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and it's here plus xi equals comes and
this problem is the same rules each

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:90%
letter has to be a digit 0 through 9 no
2 letters can be the same digit same

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:84%
rules that we've been playing all day

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:39.300 align:middle line:90%
again this is a good chance for you to
pause the video and try this one out on

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:90%
your own see if you can do it all on
your own and then watch the video and

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
see how I did

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:90%
ok so I'm going to go to the next screen
again it's a good idea deposit and try

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.140 align:middle line:90%
but i'm going to go ahead and solve this
thing ok

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:90%
as I'm working here again the first
thing that I look at is the sea out

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.299 align:middle line:90%
front I know that that C has to be a one
it can't be anything bigger than that he

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:90%
has to be a one and eliminate some
possibilities here in just a moment

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:90%
next then I look at that H and I don't
know that

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:26.210 align:middle line:84%
h+ nothing has to equal 10 or bigger

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:90%
hey so that's tough to do because the
biggest number H could be as a nine so

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:48.809 align:middle line:90%
i'm going to go ahead and assume that H
must be 9 h is nine

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:55.169 align:middle line:90%
all right and if the h and here is nine
then the h and she is also nine so we

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:59.429 align:middle line:90%
know that I also know that i must be
carrying a one up here at the top

00:21:59.429 --> 00:22:03.389 align:middle line:84%
because 1 plus 9 equals 10

00:22:03.389 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:84%
ok so that

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:20.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh must be 0 so i know that i know all
must be 0

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:90%
there we go it's coming along now ok now
I'm to the part where and i'm not

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:90%
exactly sure where to go next so what I
need to do is I just need to try some

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:90%
arm different numbers and see if they
work or not I had to do some trial and

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.880 align:middle line:84%
error

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.440 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it might work sometimes it
doesn't work ok so let's look at me

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.000 align:middle line:90%
there's 1 2 3 4 e's so if i could figure
out yet but I could figure out the rest

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.020 align:middle line:84%
of this problem

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:54.700 align:middle line:90%
let's make a guess 4e ok last time he
was five

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.420 align:middle line:90%
so let's try that again see if it works
again let's try

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
II that's 5k and already I can see that
that's not going to work because 5+5

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:90%
would equal zero which means s would
have to be 0 and s can't be 0 because 0

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.860 align:middle line:84%
is already 0 so that's not going to work

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:90%
he can't be five so let me get my eraser
out

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:34.840 align:middle line:90%
he's not five I know that ok so over on
my own chart over here I know that II

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
can't be five eliminate that possibility

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:46.000 align:middle line:90%
ok let's try for maybe he is for that's
worth a try

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.150 align:middle line:90%
ok four plus for then would be eight so
s might be eight means this s is eight

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.470 align:middle line:84%
ok that looks good so far

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:09.429 align:middle line:90%
then r + 9 has to equal 4 r plus 9 is
equal for that means our must be five is

00:24:09.429 --> 00:24:20.559 align:middle line:90%
five plus nine is 14 then I could carry
a 1 over here 1 plus 4 is 55 plus 8 is

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.620 align:middle line:84%
the team carry the one which I needed

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:28.299 align:middle line:90%
hey how it looks like we have a winner
here let's double check our answer

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:34.809 align:middle line:90%
really quick go through to make sure
that it makes sense if he is 44 plus 4

00:24:34.809 --> 00:24:38.169 align:middle line:84%
is 8 s must be eight

00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:43.120 align:middle line:84%
ok then five plus nine is 14

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
carry the 1 1 plus 4 is 55 plus 8 is 13
carry the 1 1 plus 9 is 10 carry the one

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.480 align:middle line:90%
so it looks like there's our answer i'm
going to go ahead and fill in my chart

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
here real quick

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
I found my answer

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:07.120 align:middle line:90%
notice I didn't get my answer right on
the first try first I thought that he

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
was five

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.690 align:middle line:90%
ok and so I did a little bit of math and
figured out that there's no way each

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:90%
could have been five so i eliminated
five from the possibilities and I just

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.049 align:middle line:84%
tried a different number

00:25:20.049 --> 00:25:24.070 align:middle line:90%
and don't be afraid to just do some
trial and error and try different

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:90%
numbers out and see if you can come up
with the right one

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:90%
all right it looks like I finished that
problem

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
the next slide is your homework problem

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:90%
ok and this one you're going to have to
try all on your own if you want to work

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:90%
with a partner to solve this one that's
okay you can work with a partner

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.520 align:middle line:84%
the next one is called wow wow so cook

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:90%
ok and it goes like this i dinnae was
having an argument with her roommate

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Frankie about whether or not Frankie
could cook after arguing for a while

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:84%
then they said wow so cook

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Frankie who was a math teacher noticed
that donate what dinnae said might be a

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.200 align:middle line:84%
crypt arithmetic problem

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:90%
she sat down to work on it and then they
ended up cooking dinner

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:90%
each letter in the crypt arithmetic
problem stands for a different digit

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
hint

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.850 align:middle line:84%
k equals nine okay so they're giving UK

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that's good i know that k equals nine

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I also know that see got to equal one

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:90%
so there's only three letters less a w +
0 and then s

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
those are the only three letters that
you have to figure out this problem

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.980 align:middle line:90%
looks really really simple but it's a
little trickier than you think so you've

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.730 align:middle line:90%
got to be very careful with it but you
only have three letters to figure out w

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:84%
ons if you can solve this problem

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:57.980 align:middle line:90%
you don't need to write any paragraphs
today just um solve this problem find

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:90%
out what W equals what o is equal and
what s equals good luck I hope this

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
comes easy to you if you need to go back
and watch this video game that's no

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
problem

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.920 align:middle line:84%
thank you and i will see you soon bye
